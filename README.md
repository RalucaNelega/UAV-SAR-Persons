# UAV-SAR-Persons
This repository contains a specialized dataset of high-resolution aerial imagery designed for training and evaluating object detection models in Search and Rescue (SAR) scenarios, specifically for missing person identification.

## Dataset description
The images in this dataset were acquired using a DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise. The collection focuses on natural landscapes with low to moderate vegetation density to enhance model robustness against seasonal changes.

## Repository structure
The data is organized into two main directories:
- `/images`:  Contains the aerial images.
- `/labels`: Contains the annotation files in YOLO format corresponding to each image.

## Citation
If you use this dataset in your research or publication, please cite the associated work or acknowledge the authors accordingly.

**Note**:  The official paper associated with this dataset is currently not yet published. Once it is available, the full reference and DOI will be added here.
